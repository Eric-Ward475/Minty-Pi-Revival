# Things I'm Working on Resolving

1: How to connect the display to the Pi

2: Recreating the button pcb

3: Modifying the printable files

4: Finding a final way to put everything together in a way that looks good.


I'd be willing to accept some help with the button PCB part, DM me on Discord if you are interested in helping (My account it found on the website linked to on my Github profile.)

# Things I'd like to add/improve in the future

1: Headphone Jack

2: Better model computers (Like the Raxda line.)
