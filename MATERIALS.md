# Materials


So far, I have found the following:

Raspberry Pi 0 W (Wireless for easy game transfer and ssh capabilities)
OR:
Raspberry Pi 0 2 W (Amost double the power at roughly the same pricepoint.)



16gb micro sd card (You can fit a hell of a lot of games on this)


**I have more (with links too), they are just on another computer. I will make those changes to this as soon as I can.**
