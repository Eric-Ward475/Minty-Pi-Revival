# Changelog

## November 2024
November 14, 2024: Repo Created, Base material list created

November 15, 2024: Added to Material list, posted some links. Added 3d print files DIR as well as the original MintyPi files

November 16, 2024: Not much today, I will be slowing down the rate of commits, because I am working on the first prototype of the MintyPi. I will start working on it as soon as I get parts. Just so the (currently one person) who is watching this project knows how my progress is coming, I will still post daily progress reports here. I expect to have the very first prototype complete by the end of this month. Thanks for supporting and watching this project.

November 21, 2024: Sorry for the lack of updates. I ordered the parts that I'll need for a basic version of this and I expect to be able to start working on it this upcoming week. I'll let you all know when I start working on it.
