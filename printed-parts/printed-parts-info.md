# Printed Parts Guide and Info

The official files will most likely NOT be used. With different parts being availible now, I will likely have to make modifications to these to accomidate the new parts. EX: The battery is a different form factor, so the bottom plate will probably have to me modified.
The only reason these files are here is to credit the original creator and add more flexibility for others to make their own versions of this. When a prototype of this is ready, I will add a detailed guide on how to build the entire thing. The guide for what setting to print the parts (Infill, supports, filament, etc) at will he here.
