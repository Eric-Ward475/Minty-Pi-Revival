# MintyPi-Revival

This is my take on the MintyPi project originally created by wermy on YouTube.
The project was discontinued and I found the idea really interesting, so I decided to try and take on the challenge. My goal for this is to make this as easy as possible for the avereage person to build, all while keeping everything open source so that others can make their own changes as well.

What is a MintyPi?
A MintyPi is a handheld game console based on raspberry pi and fit into the form factor of an Altoids tin.

Why am I recreating it?
Because I love the concept and was really sad to see such a good idea be discontinued like this. I will credit wermy whenever neccisary, as I know that I will be using a lot of the resources that he left in videos as well as on his wiki/website.

How complex is this for a complete beginner in electronics?
I think that all the skills that you would need to complete this is a general knowledge of soldering, RPI and a little bit of linus know how.

Where can I download everything?
All the files will be in this reposotory, ready to be downloaded. There will also be detailed documentation for every step of the project.

What games can it run?
NES, SNES, GB, GBA, GBC, PS1 (Roughly), Most MAME games (Arcade), Genesis, Sega CD, Neo-Geo, DOS Box, and other, I am sure (If you OC it)

NOTE:
This is currently a work-in-progress, meaning that I am adding things as I go. I am aiming to have some type of a prototype of it ready before the start of December 2024. My aim is to have a finished(ish) product ready for you guys to make by Christmas.

I won't post any pages for ROMS or how to pirate games. It's up to you to figure out how you want to get your games.
